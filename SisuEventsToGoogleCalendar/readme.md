Transfers all events set visible from Sisu to google calendar
The easy way to do this is to click a button made specifically
for this purpose in Sisu. Found this out only once I was almost done. 

This code does not work by itself, see

to find out what to put inside files cookies.json, credentials.json
This is done to grant access for the code to your google calendar.
takes maybe 5 mins
